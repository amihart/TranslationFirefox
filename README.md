## Translator

A translator add on for Firefox for my personal use, although you can use it too. Only supports some websites and some elements on those sites.

## Supported websites

Currently Bilibili and Dodo.

## How to Install

On the github page, click "Code" and then "Download ZIP", extract the ZIP somewhere and then in Firefox go to "about:debugging" then click "This Firefox" and then "Load Temporary Add-on..." and find the files you just extracted and load the "manifest.json" file.

## How to Use

Move your mouse over an element and press F1 to translate it, press F1 again to untranslate it. You can also press F2 to update the extension.
